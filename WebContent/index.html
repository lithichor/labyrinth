	<h1>The Labyrinth</h1>
	<p>
		The Labyrinth is a rogue-like video game with an API-only interface. What does 
		that mean? It means this is a game for developers, not for gamers. If you want 
		to adapt this game and make it your own, go for it. You'll need to set up a 
		server, then make a front end. The API Client is available to you in another 
		repository.
